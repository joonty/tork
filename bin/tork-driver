TORK-DRIVER 1 2012-01-27 17.0.0
==============================================================================

NAME
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tork-driver - drives tork-master(1) and does bookkeeping

SYNOPSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`tork-driver` [*OPTION*]...

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program reads the following single-line commands (JSON arrays) from its
standard input stream and performs the respective actions as described below.
It also funnels the standard output stream of tork-master(1) into its own.

`["run_all_test_files"]`
  Runs all test files found within and beneath the current working directory.

`["stop_running_test_files"]`
  Stops any test files that are currently running.

`["rerun_passed_test_files"]`
  Runs all test files that have passed during their most recent run.

`["reabsorb_overhead_files"]`
  Stops any test files that are currently running, reabsorbs the test
  execution overhead, and resumes running those interrupted test files.

`["quit"]`
  Stops all tests that are currently running and exits.

When tork-herald(1) reports that a file belonging to the test execution
overhead has been modified, this program replaces tork-master(1) with a new
instance, which then absorbs the modified test execution overhead into itself.

This program emits the following single-line status messages (JSON arrays) on
its standard output stream to provide notifications about its activity:

`["over",` *overhead_file*`]`
  The test execution overhead is currently being reabsorbed, by replacing
  tork-master(1) with a new instance, because *overhead_file* has changed.

OPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-h`, `--help`
  Display this help manual using man(1).

FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*.tork.rb*
  Optional Ruby script for configuring tork(1).

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`TORK_CONFIGS`
  A single-line JSON array containing paths to actual files or names of
  helper libraries in the tork/config/ namespace of Ruby's load path.
  These configuration files are loaded just before *.tork.rb* is loaded.
