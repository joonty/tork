# TORK-REMOTE 1 2012-09-26 18.2.3

## NAME

tork-remote - controls tork(1) programs

## SYNOPSIS

`tork-remote` [*OPTION*]... *PROGRAM*

## DESCRIPTION

This program sends single-line JSON messages read from its stdin to the given
*PROGRAM* which is already running in the same working directory as this one.
It prints single-line JSON messages received from the *PROGRAM* to its stdout.

### Handling non-JSON lines

If lines read from its stdin are not single-line JSON messages, then it splits
them into an array of words just like sh(1) does for command-line arguments,
and sends that array as a single-line JSON message to the *PROGRAM*.

If lines received from the *PROGRAM* are not single-line JSON messages, then
it prints them to its stderr.

## OPTIONS

`-h`, `--help`
  Show this help manual.

## EXIT STATUS

1
  Could not connect to the *PROGRAM*.

2
  Lost connection to the *PROGRAM*.
