# TORK-MASTER 1 2012-07-11 18.2.2

## NAME

tork-master - absorbs overhead and runs tests

## SYNOPSIS

`tork-master` [*OPTION*]...

## DESCRIPTION

This program absorbs the test execution overhead and forks to run your tests.
It reads the following single-line commands (JSON arrays) from its standard
input stream and performs the respective actions as described below.

`["load",` *paths*`,` *files*`]`
  Adds the given array of *paths* to Ruby's $LOAD_PATH, loads the given array
  of *files* after removing their ".rb" file extension if present, and prints
  the given command line to the standard output stream.

`["test",` *test_file*`,` *line_numbers*`]`
  Runs the given *test_file* in a forked child process while instructing your
  chosen unit testing framework (loaded by your test execution overhead) to
  only run those tests that are defined on the given array of *line_numbers*.

  Prints the following status messages to the standard output stream.  The
  standard output and error streams of the forked child process are captured
  in the *log_file* specified in these status messages.

  * Test is running:
    `["test",` *test_file*`,` *line_numbers*`,` *log_file*`,` *worker_number*`]`

  * Test has passed:
    `["pass",` *test_file*`,` *line_numbers*`,` *log_file*`,` *worker_number*`,` *exit_code*`,` *exit_info*`]`

  * Test has failed:
    `["fail",` *test_file*`,` *line_numbers*`,` *log_file*`,` *worker_number*`,` *exit_code*`,` *exit_info*`]`

`["stop",` *signal*`]`
  Stops all tests that are currently running by sending the given *signal*
  (default `SIGTERM`) to their worker processes and then prints the given
  command line to the standard output stream.

`["quit"]`
  Stops all tests that are currently running and exits.

## OPTIONS

`-h`, `--help`

## FILES

*.tork.rb*
  Optional Ruby script for configuring tork(1).

## ENVIRONMENT

`TORK_CONFIGS`
  A single-line JSON array containing paths to actual files or names of
  helper libraries in the tork/config/ namespace of Ruby's load path.
  These configuration files are loaded just before *.tork.rb* is loaded.
